# Similarity metrics of images
In this project, a CNN model will be trained, and it will perform segmentation and classification on images that it has
not yet seen. Instead, similarity metrics are used.

## Project setup
1. Only a small portion of the data is saved in the repository. Most of the data will be collected through the cloud
or SSD.

## Ideas for custom similarity metrics
1. See `7. Application to Object Recognition` in `Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints`

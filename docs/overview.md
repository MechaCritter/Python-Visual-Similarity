# Developer Overview

`pyvisim` computes image similarity by turning images into fixed-size vectors and
comparing those vectors with a similarity function. This document explains how the
pieces fit together so you can extend the library or debug it.

Per-area docs:

- [Typing](typing.md): Public types (`MatLike`, `ImageInput`, `Encoder`).
- [Encoders](encoders/): how images become vectors.
- [Image store](image_store.md): cache image encodings keyed by file path.
- [Clustering](clustering/): the KMeans, GMM, and PCA models the encoders build their
  vocabulary with.
- [Features](features/): how local descriptors are extracted from an image.
- [Retrieval](retrieval/): search indexes and the `ImageRetriever` for fast
  top-k image search over an encoding map.
- [Neural networks](neural_networks/): planned Siamese network.
- [Dataset](dataset/): the bundled Oxford Flowers dataset class.

## The core pipeline

Every encoder follows the same three-stage flow:

```
image (NumPy array)
   │  feature extractor   (features/)
   ▼
local descriptors  (N, D)
   │  optional PCA, then clustering model (KMeans or GMM)
   ▼
aggregated vector  (fixed size, independent of N)
   │  power + L2 normalization
   ▼
encoding  →  similarity_func  →  similarity score
```

The key property is that the number of local descriptors `N` varies per image, but
the aggregated encoding has a fixed length. That is what makes two images comparable
with a single similarity function.

## Two abstract interfaces

Everything is built on the two abstract base classes in
[`_base_classes.py`](../pyvisim/_base_classes.py):

- `SimilarityMetric`: anything that can produce a `similarity_score` between two
  images. Both the encoders and the `Pipeline` implement this.
- `FeatureExtractorBase`: anything that maps one image to a `(N, D)` array of
  descriptors via `__call__`, and reports its `output_dim`. Used to validate that a
  feature extractor matches the clustering model and PCA it is paired with.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **NumPy, torch, or array-like images.** Encoders and feature extractors accept `MatLike`
  inputs: NumPy arrays, PyTorch tensors, or anything `numpy.asarray` can turn into a
  numeric array. Use the `dims` string (e.g. `"HWC"`, `"BCHW"`) to describe the axis
  layout, and `value_range` to rescale float inputs into `[0, 255]`. See
  [typing.md](typing.md).
- **Similarity metric is chosen by name.** `similarity_func` takes one of the built-in
  metric names: `"cosine"` (default), `"euclidean"`, `"l1"` or `"manhattan"`.
- **Trained encoders persist to safetensors `.encoder` files.** `save_to_disk` /
  `load_from_disk` capture everything (clustering model, PCA, normalization settings,
  similarity metric and feature extractor), so loading only needs the path. Bundled
  pretrained encoders load via `from_pretrained`.
  See [encoders/weights.md](encoders/weights.md).

## Retrieval

[`functional.py`](../pyvisim/functional.py) holds `retrieve_top_k_similar`, the
entry point for ranking a gallery against query images. Give it a batch of query
images and an [`ImageEncodingMap`](image_store.md) gallery and it returns one
ranked `list[Candidate]` per query, where each `Candidate` carries a `path` and a
`score`. By default it compares every gallery vector (brute-force cosine); pass an
`index=` and the search runs through the, which is significantly faster. The
[`retrieval`](retrieval/) package wraps all of this: build an `ImageIndexIVFFlat`
or `ImageIndexIVFPQ` over your encoding map and hand it to an `ImageRetriever`.

## Evaluation

[`eval.py`](../pyvisim/eval.py) provides methods to compute the performance
of the retrieval pipeline, given the ground-truth labels. Currently available:
- `top_k_map`: mean Average Precision over a set of queries.
- `top_k_accuracy`: fraction of queries whose top-k contains a label match.

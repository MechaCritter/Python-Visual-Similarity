# Image Features / Embeddings

## Overview

This module focuses on implementing image features and embeddings for visual data processing. The goal is to extract
meaningful information from images, such as vector representations or embeddings, that can be used for tasks like
classification, clustering, retrieval or similarity comparison.

## Features to Include:

- **Feature Extraction**: Implement methods to extract key features from images using state-of-the-art techniques.
- **Embeddings Creation**: Develop embeddings that encode the visual information into compact, vectorized forms.
- **Support for Pre-trained Models**: Incorporate popular pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) to
  generate and use embeddings effectively.
